  "paragraph": "Iris is the first minimal visual sequencer, we focused on iris being intuitive. Iris frees you from time, and organizes your thoughts into space. You can understand how a track will sound just by looking at it, using your visual cortex to help you make music. Plug in to Ableton Live , Logic , Cubase or anything else that uses Midi. By imagining how a visual sequencer should work, we re-thought how time can work. Iris was the result Iris frees you from the constraints of a timeline, enables you to jam, play, create structures on the fly in a repeatable way",
