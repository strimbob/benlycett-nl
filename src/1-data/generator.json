  "paragraph": "Generator is an immersive, site-specific sound and light installation that captures, relocates and interprets the sounds, colours and movement of the castle’s hydro-electric turbine. Audio and video field recordings from the turbine room and water management structures are processed by the installation’s control system and re-presented as sequenced light animations and spatialised audio - bringing the workings of the ever-present but nonetheless ‘hidden’ generator within the exhibition space itself. Generator explores the exhibition theme by reflecting on the water cycle - the periodic journey water takes as it circulates from land to sky and back again - illustrating how practical responses to notions of ‘seamlessness’ through harnessing the energy of the neighbouring river, has been a part of the workings of the venue for centuries.",
