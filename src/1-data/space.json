  "paragraph": "A live audiovisual performance linking the melodies and sonic textures within a minimal techno soundscape directly to abstract visualisations inspired by experimental animators Larry Cuba and John Whitney Sr. Integrating the algorithms used by seminal experimental computer animators Larry Cuba and John Whitney Sr - in openFrameworks, the open source C++ toolkit for creative coding. This video is an edit of several live recordings made using the software. While it may lack the natural 'flow' of a live performance, it better demonstrates the overall capabilities of the system which is still a little tricky to control. Development is ongoing and future iterations will address these issues.",
  "intro": "An a attempt to show a deeper connection between what is heard and what is seen. By looking for similar qualities to the vibrations that generate sound in the visual domain.",
